### As part of the Reimagined Hackathon 2025, we have built

### <span style='color:#1E90FF;'> Augur - Deployed Machine learning classification Model (Random Forest) </span>
- ** We built a machine learning model in Azure ML studio using No/Low code solution that predicts fair value classification levels, significantly reducing manual work involved in the IFRS13 Fair Value classification process.

 ### <span style='color:#1E90FF;'> Automated Risk Factor Observability Testing for 2 use cases </span>
- ** We built a risk factor observability testing solution that automates the risk factor observability testing for 2 use cases, significantly reducing manual work involved in the IFRS13 Fair Value classification process.

### <span style='color:#1E90FF;'> Integration with Azure Open AI Models to explain classification rationale </span>
- ** We built an integration with Azure Open AI Models to explain the classification rationale, significantly reducing manual work involved in the IFRS13 Fair Value classification process.

### <span style='color:#1E90FF;'> Built a Streamlit UI to demo the solution </span>
